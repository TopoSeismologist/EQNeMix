## 1. What will you find in this repository?
EQNeMix is a mixed architecture that combines two widely-used neural networks in seismology: **ConvNetQuake** (*Perol et al., 2018*) and **EQTransformer** (*Mousavi et al., 2020*). Our algorithm employs a *Gaussian Mixture Model* to perform a *Bayesian Inference* using the outputs generated by both neural networks. The ultimate outcome is a *probabilistic location* pinpointed using just a *single seismic station*.

* An integral facet of its versatile design is the algorithm's adaptability, as it is not confined to a single travel-time algorithm. It accommodates a spectrum of options ranging from simpler to more intricate travel-time methods. Furthermore, various sampling techniques such as variational inference, Hamiltonian sampling, among others, can be seamlessly integrated. 

* This algorithm is applicable not only to individual seismic stations but can also be extended to entire seismic networks.
